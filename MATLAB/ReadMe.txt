We here provide the Matlab implementation of both *SIMLR* and *CIMLR*. 

**SETUP**

Before running our tool, the user needs to mex compile serveral C-mex files. This can be done by running the code *SETUP.m*. 

**DEMO**

We provide two demos for the usage of *SIMLR* in both small scale and large scale implementations. In *Matlab_main_demo_SIMLR.m* we run *SIMLR* on 4 small-scale datasets while in *Matlab_main_demo_SIMLR_Large_Scale.m*, we show an example of how to run our tool on 1 large scale dataset.
